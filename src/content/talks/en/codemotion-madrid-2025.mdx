    In this talk, we'll provide a brief introduction to web components and how they can improve the user experience and unify the user interface. We'll cover everything from simple composition examples to complex dependency injection examples to integrate them into hexagonal architectures or modify their functionality depending on where we incorporate them. In short, a complete overview of the basics of web components, including how to implement i18n, signals, and context. Everything you need to know to start incorporating web components into your user interfaces.
